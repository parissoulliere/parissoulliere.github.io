  <h2> Objective </h2>
  <p> From this class, I'd like to become more skilled using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create applications both aesthetically-pleasing and interactive, so that I can apply for a front end development internship in the future, and maybe even make a career out of it someday. </p>

  <h2> Experience </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> VIK Club - After School Program </li>
      <p> For a year, I worked for Gilbert Public Schools' VIK Club, which is essentially a before and after school program dedicated to looking after elementary school kids whose parents work early mornings or late evenings. Some of my responsibilities were to serve the children breakfast, hot lunch, and snacks; help the children with their homework; play with the children; organize activities and field trips. </p>
    <li> F45 Training </li>
      <p> For a few months, I worked as a receptionist for F45 Training. During my time at this gym, I helped book appointments, signed people up for various memberships, sold merchandise, kept the gym and its equipment clean, and worked to build up their social media presence. </p>
  </ol>
